Flickr-Feed
===========

A very simple PHP class that connects to the Flickr API and retrieves your latest photo's. Although this is targeting Flickr it could easily be changed to query any other API for content. This class doesn’t implement any OAuth process so some information by API’s will be out of bounds.
